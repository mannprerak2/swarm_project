Genetic algorithm based scheduler for Engifest.

## Todo
- [ ] Collect basic Engifest events data - Name, Timings, Duration (in excel sheet).
- [ ] Create and assign tags to describe these events.
- [ ] Make constraints for events, E.g - concerts at day end, no high rated events happening at the same time, no similar events happening consecutively.
- [ ] Add events and constraints to account for meal breaks.
